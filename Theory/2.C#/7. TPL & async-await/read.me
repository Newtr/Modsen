Task: 
Create a console application that performs the following tasks in parallel:
Loading data (simulated by a 3-second delay).
Processing data (simulated by a 2-second delay).
Saving data (simulated by a 1 second delay). Use async and await to perform these tasks asynchronously, and use TPL to perform multiple operations in parallel.
