Task: 
Create a console application that accepts a number from a user as input. 
Use if to test whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. 
Use foreach to output numbers from 1 to the number the user entered. 
In case of incorrect input (e.g., a letter), use switch to treat the input as an error.
